 /*
 WHAT IS RECURSION?
 - When a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.
 - Here the specified condition is the base condition. Once that is met the function starts returning itself back.
 - We will be using stack space to hold the incomplete functions in order. 
 - Once the function at the top of the stack hits the base condition. It moves down the stack space.
