/*Given a collection of numbers, and a target number, we need to find all the unique combinations in arr where the candidate numbers sum to target.
So basically the numbers should be unique and if we have same numbers, the sequence should still be the same. 
example: 
arr = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2] target = 4
answer: [1, 1, 2], [2, 2]
